# 👋 Hey there!

I'm *Ylli**, an aspiring Software Engineer with a love for clean code, creative design, and coffee (sometimes too much ☕).

## 🚀 About Me

- 🧠 Started coding at 16 with HTML & CSS — yes, I was that teen styling buttons for fun.
- 💻 Today, I work with **Java**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.
- ☁️ Passionate about **Software Development**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Digital Design**.
- 🧩 I enjoy solving problems, breaking things (intentionally 👀), and learning something new every day.

## 🛠️ Currently
- Building cool projects 🔨  
- Solving LeetCode puzzles like a brain gym 🧠  
- Probably debugging something I broke 😅
